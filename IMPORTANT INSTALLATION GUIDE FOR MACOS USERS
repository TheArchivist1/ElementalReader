IMPORTANT FOR MACOS:
Because the MacOS version is not yet signed, you must manually unlock the app, or it will say that the file is damaged.
To do this:
  1. After opening the .dmg, drag the Elemental Reader.app into the applications folder in the little window.
  2. Open your terminal and run: "xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Applications/Elemental Reader.app"

This will allow you to run the app.

We intend to get the app signed soon, but Apple charges a good chunk of cash to do so...
